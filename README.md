This report is part of my cybersecurity internship task (Task 3), where I performed a basic vulnerability scan on my personal computer using Nessus Essentials.

The purpose of this scan was to identify existing vulnerabilities, understand their severity, and suggest possible fixes. The scan targeted my local system (IP: 192.168.80.198) and revealed several low, medium, and informational level issues.

The screenshot attached in this report shows the scan results, which include the number of vulnerabilities and their breakdown by severity level.

Tool Used: Nessus Essentials (Free Version)  
Scan Type: Basic Network Scan  
Date: [Insert Date of Scan]

This exercise helped me understand how vulnerability scanning works and how to interpret the findings from automated tools.
